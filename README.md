# HR Mini Case Study ðŸ‘ª

## Introduction
The data for this case study was taken from ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset). It contains information about employees in a company, including their educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. The goal of this project is to generate meaningful insights using SQL and a Power BI dashboard. All insights presented in this project are original and have been independently developed by me.
